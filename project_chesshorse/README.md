The idea in this project is to find a solution for the problem of the horse in the chess game.

PROBLEM: lets say you have a chess board of 6x6 squares and you
release a horse in any position of the board. Find a path for the
horse that uses all the 36 squares.

ADVANCE QUESTIONS: a) is this path unique? how many solutions are
		   there?  b) And if the board is not 6x6 but it is
		   8x8, or even if it is a rectangle 6x4
